# SnackSavers
App enabling restaurants to sell unsold food to reduce costs &amp; reduce food waste.

## Description
SnackSavers is a platform that lets restaurants and bakeries list and sell surplus food at a reduced price in order to mitigate costs and eliminate food waste. Restaurants get to earn additional revenue on otherwise excess food and customers get access to cheap but good quality food.


Download our app to easily find and buy surplus food in your neighbourhood!


It's so easy to do.

Step 1: Search for a restaurant that has unsold food. 

Step 2: Purchase the food for a fraction of the price.

Step 3: Collect the food and enjoy the delicious treat!
 

This food waste problem is critically important to solve as one third of all food is wasted globally, with Australians wasting a staggering 300 kg per person per year, ranking them the fourth highest food wasting nation in the world. But we can change that!



We are passionate about solving this problem because perfectly edible food can be saved from going to waste at restaurants, hotels, supermarkets and food manufacturers.


Together, let's help our planet while enjoying delicious food!
